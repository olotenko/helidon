/**
 * A generic processor used for the implementation of {@link Multi} and {@link Single}.
 * <p>
 * Implementing Processor interface, delegating invocations to downstreamSubscribe, next and complete
 * at the right times
 * <p>
 * Such right times are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>1. downstream onSubscription - only after both downstream called subscribe and upstream called
 * onSubscription</li>
 * <li>2. downstream onNext - will not happen before request(...)</li>
 * <li>3. upstream request / cancel - will not happen before request(...) / cancel()</li>
 * <li>4. request(...) / cancel() - will not happend before downstream onSubscription</li>
 * <li>5. downstream onError / onComplete - will not happen before downstream onSubcription</li>
 * <li>6. upstream onError / onComplete - may happen any time after upstream onSubscription, so keep track
 * of upstream completion</li>
 * <li>7. upstream onNext - will not happen before request(...)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The order in which subscribe and onSubscription get called is not defined, so if you want to
 * interact with upstream before downstreamSubscribe is called, you need to take care of the possibility
 * that the downstream may have not called subscribe() yet (ie is not set up). In that case you may be
 * better off implementing Processor yourself, not subclassing from BaseProcessor.
 * <p>
 * downstreamSubscribe needs to be called once and only once, whereas subscribe and onSubscription
 * may be called by different threads - so ensuring atomicity of Subscriber's state transition.
 * These methods are meant to be called only once, and by no more than one thread each, no need to do
 * anything more complicated than synchronized.
 *
 * @param <T> subscribed type (input)
 * @param <U> published type (output)
